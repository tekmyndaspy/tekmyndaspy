# TekMyndAspy
## Who am I?
### What should you call me?
- Screen Name: TekMyndAspy
- Name: Sadie S.
### _How_ should you call me?
- he/him
- she/her
- they/them
- I literally just do not care.
### What do I like?
- Open Source Software\
I like it. I just really really like it as a concept. Being able to see what makes up a program before I run it is just so good. Takes a load off the mind.
- Privacy Respecting Software\
Similar to above, I just like knowing a piece of software isn't reporting back to some shady group of people. Gives me peace of mind.
- _Libre_ Software\
Need I say more?
- Games\
I have fun playing games in my free time, be it Team Fortress 2, Terraria, or Rimworld.
- Programming\
Despite loving it, I really don't do it enough. When I have the free time, I don't have the motivation. When I have the motivation, I don't have the free time. When I have both, I have impostor syndrome.
### What do I dislike?
- Rude People\
They just sorta break my vibe. Y'know? Y'know.
- Toxic Positivity\
It's the other side of rudeness.
